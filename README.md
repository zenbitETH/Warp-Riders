# Warp Riders
NFT community for stakeholders on digital public goods for web3 Cities  
Developed at [Metabolism](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/warp-riders-9utay)  

## About
This is an NFT marketplace based on ZoraAPI and a collection minted on mainnet Zora to mint characters related to web3 cities development. The Web3 Citizen is the first character and by getting it you are supporting the development of digital public goods for web3 cities. As web3 Citizen you will have to bridge IRL places with the metaverse using Punk Cities. Go outside and collect the public places in your city, just remember to use sunscreen!

Warp Riders uses Zora protocol on mainnet for the Web3 Citizen Collection contract, it uses a typescript template built by tranqui.eth x sofja, it also integrates tailwind CSS styles with 3dassets from Punk Cities game fetched from IPFS and the Zora API with the ask function for mint NFTs on the dapp
